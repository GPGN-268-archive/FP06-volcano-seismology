### Summary
This project aims to analyze seismic data originating from volcanic eruptions in order to determine whether the onset of an eruption has a distinguishable pattern that can be observed.

### Background Information
Volcanic eruptions cause seismic activity, and we are looking to analyze the relationship between the eruptions and seismic activity through datasets provided from places such as USGS, Pacific Northwest Seismic Network, etc.


### Problem Statement
#### Natural disasters can pose great dangers towards human civilization and infrastructure. The capacity to predict the onset of natural disasters, therefore, provides an opportunity to afford greater protection to those elements of the modern world. Therefore, our research goal is the following: Through analysis of volcanologically originating seismic data, are there discernible, significant, and common patterns of ground-movement present at the onset of volcanic eruptions? If so, how can systems be implemented to be able to detect these patterns and thus determine when an eruption has taken, or is about to take, place?


### Datasets
USGS
Pacific Northwest Seismic Network


### Tools/Packages
- Python
  - Python will be the main tool for data visualization and processing. Some of the Python libraries will also be used
- MatPlotLib
  - This Python library will be utilized for graphing of data and creation of figures
- Numpy
  - This Python library will be utilized for processing of datasets and easier manipulation of data


### Planned Methodology
- Start by researching the datasets, and think about how we can analyze these datasets.
- Form a plan for what we want to find.
  - What visualizations should we make?
  - How many different datasets should we analyze?
  - What constitutes significant similarities?
- Analyze the datasets with python.
  - Perform any operations on datasets needed.
  - Select correct ranges of data.
- Interpret and write up a report describing our results.

### Expected Outcomes
It is our expectation that we will be able to formulate a comprehensive analysis of eruption seismic data and generate a deeper and useful interpretation of the data such that our problem statement goals are met.
